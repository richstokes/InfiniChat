# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! All kinds of contributions are welcome — bug reports, feature suggestions, documentation improvements, or pull requests.

## How to Contribute

- **Fork** the repo
- **Create a branch** for your change (`git checkout -b feature-name`)
- **Make your changes**
- **Commit** your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`)
- **Push** to your fork (`git push origin feature-name`)
- **Open a pull request**

I'll review it as soon as I can.

## Guidelines

- Keep code clean and consistent.
- Try to keep pull requests focused and minimal.
- If you're fixing a bug, link to the issue if one exists.
- If you're adding something big or changing existing behavior, it's a good idea to open an issue first.

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful. Be constructive. Harassment, hate speech, or discrimination of any kind won’t be tolerated.
